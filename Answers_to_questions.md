# Answers to questions launched in the project
Within the project it is a must to address the following questions and tasks in your exploratory analysis. 
For each question/task a single plot is generated already in th erepository.

# Question 1
Have total emissions from PM2.5 decreased in the United States from 1999 to 2008? Using the base plotting system, make a plot showing the total PM2.5 emission from all sources for each of the years 1999, 2002, 2005, and 2008.

Answer: Yes, as it can be seen in plot1.png, total emissions has decreased in the US from 1999 to 2008

# Question 2
Have total emissions from PM2.5 decreased in the Baltimore City, Maryland (fips == "24510") from 1999 to 2008? Use the base plotting system to make a plot answering this question.

Answer: Yes, as it can be seen in plot2.png, total emissions has decreased in Baltimore from 1999 to 2008

# Question 3
Of the four types of sources indicated by the type (point, nonpoint, onroad, nonroad) variable, which of these four sources have seen decreases in emissions from 1999–2008 for Baltimore City? Which have seen increases in emissions from 1999–2008? Use the ggplot2 plotting system to make a plot answer this question.

Answer: as it can be seen in plot3.png, "nonpoint", "onroad", "nonroad" types have decreased, while "point" type one has increased.

# Question 4
Across the United States, how have emissions from coal combustion-related sources changed from 1999–2008?

Answer: Showed in plot4.png how emissions in US from coal-combustion source have changed from 1999 to 2008. It can be seen a final decreasing.

# Question 5
How have emissions from motor vehicle sources changed from 1999–2008 in Baltimore City?

Answer: Showed in plot5.png how emissions in Baltimore from motor vehicle combustion source have changed from 1999 to 2008. It can be seen a decreasing.

# Question 6
Compare emissions from motor vehicle sources in Baltimore City with emissions from motor vehicle sources in Los Angeles County, California (fips == "06037"). Which city has seen greater changes over time in motor vehicle emissions?

Answer: As it can be seen in plot6.png, emissions from motor vehicle combustion in Los Angeles has suffered greater changes than Baltimore ones.
